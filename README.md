# CloudFlare MyAlgo Button App

Let your visitors call or refer to their MyAlgo Wallet directly from your website.
This is the simplest way of integrating MyAlgo wallet to your website!
This APP will create a button and a subdomain CNAME record, based on your declared subdomain name parameter value during installation, on your site's DNS, by the name of YOUR-SUB-DOMAIN.YOUR-DOMAIN-NAME.
This way the myalgo subdomain of your website will be always redirecting to wallet.myalgo.com and there is a customizable button on your landing page to call it.

## Usage

Install the dependencies with `npm install`
